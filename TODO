Experiments

Application Scaling Test: 	TODO
not checked at all yet. should be tested

I added functionality in the user application endpoint to wait with the request if there are already 5 videos
being converted at the same time, but I haven't tested it yet. The request will simply wait in the application 
instance, after writing the input to file and creating the output file, until some other videos are done. This
is not necessarily FIFO since it also depends on when the request actually checks the counter.

I also configured the app orchestrator to keep a minimum of 2 application instances, so this test was updated 
to match that. This should still be tested.


Component Liveness Test: 	WORKS
Verifies that all components are healthy

End to End Test: 			TODO (mostly works)
I fixed the problem that was causing the broken pipe and I have implemented a fix for the second test, where the 
application instance didn't fail during testing. The first test succeeds but the second one fails because it
takes too long for the fallback application instance to become available. This might work now with the minimum
of 2 app instances. Should be tested. 

Instance Recovery Test:		TODO
not checked at all yet. should be tested

Performance Stress Test: 	TODO
single request seems to work, it calculates the metrics
needs to be checked for multiple requests (see if 100 and 1000 even work)
with the application waiting with more than 5 requests, this may be more feasible now.
should be tested.
