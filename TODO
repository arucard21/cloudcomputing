Experiments

Application Scaling Test: 	TODO
not checked at all, but we may need to change how the app orchestrator scales up and down
maybe it should work as follows:
- scale down if mean requests per instance <= 1
- scale up if mean requests per instance >= 3
- reject new requests if mean requests per instance >= 5 
this way we don't crash the applications if we get a burst of requests

alternatively, we can store the input videos on the application instance and have it get to it later
(so we create a queue in the application instance)
this way, we won't have to change the scaling mechanism and seems less likely to break existing functionality.

Component Liveness Test: 	WORKS
Verifies that all components are healthy

End to End Test: 			TODO 
only checked the test where everything remains working, it seems to give a false positive 
because the application log still shows the broken pipe error. I think the test is okay, but
we just need to manually check that the error isn't showing when we run this.

Instance Recovery Test:		TODO
not checked at all yet.

Performance Stress Test: 	TODO
single request seems to work, it calculates the metrics
needs to be checked for multiple requests (see if 100 and 1000 even work)
we might need to modify the scaling up/down mechanism and actually reject some requests if overloaded
