Experiments

Application Scaling Test: 	TODO
not checked at all yet

I added functionality in the user application endpoint to wait with the request if there are already 5 videos
being converted at the same time, but I haven't tested it yet. The request will simply wait in the application 
instance, after writing the input to file and creating the output file, until some other videos are done. This
is not necessarily FIFO since it also depends on when the request actually checks the counter.


Component Liveness Test: 	WORKS
Verifies that all components are healthy

End to End Test: 			TODO 
only checked the test where everything remains working, it seems to give a false positive 
because the application log still shows the broken pipe error. I think the test is okay, but
we just need to manually check that the error isn't showing when we run this.

Instance Recovery Test:		TODO
not checked at all yet.

Performance Stress Test: 	TODO
single request seems to work, it calculates the metrics
needs to be checked for multiple requests (see if 100 and 1000 even work)
we might need to modify the scaling up/down mechanism and actually reject some requests if overloaded
